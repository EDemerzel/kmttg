#TODO want to intermix these tootips with their main text above.

tooltip_tivo_name=<b>Tivo Name</b><br>\
Enter the name of a <b>TiVo</b> on your network.<br>\
kmttg tries to detect TiVos on your network automatically but that doesn't always work.<br>\
Enter corresponding <b>Tivo IP#</b> below and then click on <b>ADD</b> button.
tooltip_tivo_ip=<b>Tivo IP#</b><br>\
Enter the corresponding IP number of a TiVo on your home network.<br>\
You can find the IP number of your TiVo from the TiVo as follows:<br>\
<b>Tivo Central-Messages&Settings-Settings-Phone&Network: IP addr</b><br>\
Enter corresponding <b>Tivo Name</b> above and then click on <b>ADD</b> button.
tooltip_share_name=<b>Share Name</b><br>\
Enter the name you want to use for a video share.<br>\
These video shares are used by <b>Share Browser</b> and <b>Video Streaming-Browse Files</b><br>\
web server pages. If you don't define any custom shares then kmttg will use some default ones instead.<br>\
Enter corresponding <b>Share Directory</b> below and then click on <b>ADD</b> button.<br>\
NOTE: When changing these shares you will need to restart kmttg so the web server<br>\
will pick up the changes.
tooltip_share_dir=<b>Share Directory</b><br>\
Enter corresponding <b>Share Name</b> above and then click on <b>ADD</b> button.
tooltip_autotune_enabled=<b>Tune to specified channels before a download</b><br>\
For Series 3 & 4 TiVos that have <b>Network Remote Control</b> option enabled<br>\
you can have kmttg tune to silent channels or channels you don't receive before<br>\
initiating a download from a TiVo. This helps speed up transfer rates by removing CPU load<br>\
from the TiVo. In order for this to work you must enabled Network Remote Control feature:<br>\
<b>Tivo Central-Messages&Settings-Settings-Remote,CableCARD&Devices: Network Remote Control</b><br>\
kmttg uses LIVETV,CLEAR,CHANNEL #,ENTER network button press sequence to tune to a channel.
tooltip_autotune_channel_interval=<b>Channel change interval (secs)</b><br>\
Specifies interval of time in seconds to wait after tuning first tuner before attempting<br>\
to tune second tuner. Depending on how responsive your TiVo is this may have to be tweeked for<br>\
both channel changes to work.
tooltip_autotune_button_interval=<b>Button press interval (msecs)</b><br>\
Specifies interval of time in milliseconds to wait between network button press commands that<br>\
are sent to the TiVo for tuning. Depending on how responsive your TiVo is this may have to be<br>\
tweeked for network based channel tuning to work.
tooltip_autotune_chan1=<b>Channel number for tuner 1</b><br>\
Channel number to use for first tuner. Typically you want to set this to a music channel or<br>\
channel that you don't subscribe to so that it relieves the load on your TiVo CPU.<br>\
Both conventional integer only channel numbers and OTA style x.y or x-y are supported.
tooltip_autotune_chan2=<b>Channel number for tuner 2</b><br>\
Channel number to use for second tuner. Typically you want to set this to a music channel or<br>\
channel that you don't subscribe to so that it relieves the load on your TiVo CPU.<br>\
Both conventional integer only channel numbers and OTA style x.y or x-y are supported.
tooltip_autotune_test=<b>TEST</b><br>\
Test channel changing for currently selected TiVo based on current form settings.
tooltip_autotune_tivoName=<b>TiVo to Autotune</b><br>\
Select which TiVo you would like to configure for/test.<br>
tooltip_add=<b>ADD</b><br>\
Add specified <b>Tivo Name</b> and associated <b>Tivo IP#</b> to <b>Tivos</b> list.<br>\
kmttg tries to detect TiVos on your network automatically but that doesn't always work.
tooltip_del=<b>DEL</b><br>\
Remove currently selected entry in <b>Tivos</b> list.
tooltip_share_add=<b>ADD</b><br>\
Add specified <b>Share Name</b> and associated <b>Share Directory</b> to <b>Shares</b> list.
tooltip_share_del=<b>DEL</b><br>\
Remove currently selected entry in <b>Shares</b> list.
tooltip_remove_tivo=<b>Remove .TiVo after file decrypt</b><br>\
Enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove .TiVo files automatically<br>\
once they have been successfully decrypted to .mpg format.
tooltip_remove_comcut=<b>Remove Ad Detect files after Ad Cut</b><br>\
If you use comcut you can enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove files<br>\
associated with Ad Detect task automatically once Ad Cut job completes successfully.
tooltip_remove_comcut_mpeg=<b>Remove .mpg file after Ad Cut</b><br>\
If this option is enabled kmttg will remove the .mpg file (not the _cut.mpg file)<br>\
automatically once Ad Cut job completes successfully.
tooltip_remove_mpeg=<b>Remove .mpg file after encode</b><br>\
If you use encode you can enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove .mpg<br>\
files automatically once they have been successfully re-encoded.
tooltip_QSFixBackupMpegFile=<b>For QS Fix of .mpg file backup original .mpg</b><br>\
If running VRD QS Fix on a .mpg file kmttg will rename the original .mpg file to .mpg.bak<br>\
if this option is enabled. Otherwise kmttg removes the original .mpg file and replaces with<br>\
the fixed version following successful VideoRedo QS Fix run
tooltip_download_check_length=<b>Check download duration</b><br>\
When enabled use mediainfo CLI to determine the duration of downloaded .TiVo files<br>\
and compare against expected duration within a certain tolerance.<br>\
If a download is not within tolerance then it will be considered an error.<br>\
NOTE: This option relies on mediainfo CLI being configured and being able to<br>\
determine duration of .TiVo files properly, and also relies on TiVo duration<br>\
reported by TiVo to be accurate, so may not be 100% reliable.
tooltip_check_space=<b>Check Available Disk Space</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will check that destination drive has more than<br>\
the space available defined in <b>Min requested space (GB)</b> field before running jobs.
tooltip_beacon=<b>Look for Tivos on network</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will try to detect Tivos on your network<br>\
automatically that you have not already configured manually.<br>\
NOTE: The automatic detection is disabled automatically after about 10 minutes.
tooltip_UseOldBeacon=<b>Detect with TiVo Beacon instead of Bonjour</b><br>\
Use the old TiVo Beacon method for detecting TiVos on the network instead of the<br>\
newer Bonjour method. You can try this method if Bonjour is not working for you.
tooltip_npl_when_started=<b>Start NPL jobs when starting kmttg GUI</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will start NPL jobs for configured TiVos<br>\
right away when starting kmttg GUI. Otherwise no NPL jobs are started and you<br>\
can manually select TiVos and click on <b>Refresh</b> button to selectively start<br>\
NPL jobs.
tooltip_showHistoryInTable=<b>Highlight processed shows in history file</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will highlight shows that have been previously<br>\
processed by kmttg and have an entry in the <b>auto.history</b> file.<br>\
Useful as an easier check to see if a show has been processed before or not.<br>\
NOTE: This option affects NPL and Remote ToDo table entries only.<br>\
NOTE: If you clear out auto.history file regularly then obviously this option will<br>\
not be very useful.
tooltip_download_time_estimate=<b>Show estimated time remaining for downloads</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then download tasks will show estimated time remaining<br>\
instead of download bit rate in the status column.<br>\
NOTE: Since file size reported by TiVo is not accurate this number is also not accurate<br>\
and will never reach 0
tooltip_UseAdscan=<b>Use VideoRedo AdScan instead of comskip</b><br>\
If you have VideoRedo and have configured kmttg with the installation path<br>\
to VideoRedo, when this option is enabled kmttg will use VideoRedo instead<br>\
of <b>comskip</b> for commercials detection.
tooltip_VrdReview=<b>Use VideoRedo GUI to review detected commercials</b><br>\
If you have VideoRedo and have configured kmttg with the installation path<br>\
to VideoRedo, when this option is enabled kmttg will start VideoRedo GUI<br>\
to allow you to manually review and update the detected commercial segments<br>\
before starting the commercial cutting job. kmttg will wait until you close<br>\
the VideRedo GUI before proceeding. NOTE: Be sure to save your changes to .VPrj file<br>\
before you exit VideoRedo or they will not be used in commercial cut step.<br>\
NOTE: If you have <b>Bring up VideoRedo GUI to make manual cuts</b> option set<br>\
you will need to save the output file from VideoRedo GUI, otherwise without that<br>\
option set the cuts will be make by kmttg <b>Ad Cut</b> task.
tooltip_comskip_review=<b>Use comskip GUI to review detected commercials</b><br>\
If you have comskip configured in kmttg and <b>Ad Detect</b> task enabled,<br>\
when this option is enabled kmttg will start comskip GUI<br>\
to allow you to manually review and update the detected commercial segments<br>\
before starting the commercial cutting job. kmttg will wait until you close<br>\
the comskip GUI before proceeding.<br>\
NOTE: Press <b>F1</b> to see list of keyboard shortcuts for comskip GUI which<br>\
shows you how to set start/end of a commercial segment or insert a new one, etc.<br>\
Make sure you save your changes by pressing <b>w</b> keyboard button before you exit.<br>\
<b>IMPORTANT: When done press <b>Esc</b> keyboard button to close comskip GUI.</b><br>\
<b>Just closing the window by clicking on the X will NOT terminate comskip</b>.
tooltip_VrdReview_noCuts=<b>Bring up VideoRedo GUI to make manual cuts</b><br>\
If you have VideoRedo and have configured kmttg with the installation path<br>\
to VideoRedo, when this option is enabled kmttg will start VideoRedo GUI<br>\
to allow you create the commercial edited mpeg file manually. kmttg will wait<br>\
until you close the VideoRedo GUI before proceeding to next task.<br>\
<b>NOTE: Be sure to specify the output file using the VRD default ' (02).mpg'</b><br>\
<b>suffix or using the kmttg conventional '_cut.mpg' suffix when saving output file</b>.<br>\
NOTE: When using this option you normally want to disable <b>Ad Detect</b> task<br>\
and enable <b>Ad Cut</b> task.
tooltip_VrdQsFilter=<b>Enable VideoRedo QS Fix video dimension filter</b><br>\
If you have trouble in VideoRedo editing some files due to <b>Video Dimensions Changed</b><br>\
error message then enabling this option will apply a Video Dimensions filter as part of kmttg VRD<br>\
Quickstream Fix run that will solve that problem. Note that kmttg uses mediainfo if<br>\
available, else ffmpeg to automatically detect the mpeg video file dimensions to be used<br>\
as the filter and prepares a custom version of VRD vp.vbs file with an added filter line.
tooltip_VrdDecrypt=<b>Decrypt using VideoRedo</b><br>\
If you have VideoRedo and have configured kmttg with the installation path<br>\
to VideoRedo, when this option is enabled kmttg will use VideoRedo QSFix task<br>\
to decrypt .TiVo files instead of other methods.<br>\
NOTE: You must have TiVo Desktop (or at least TiVoDirectShowFilter.dll) installed for this to work.
tooltip_DsdDecrypt=<b>Decrypt using DirectShow Dump instead of tivodecode</b><br>\
If you have at least a partial TiVo Desktop installation with<br>\
<b>TiVoDirectShowFilter.dll</b> installed then you can enable this option to decrypt<br>\
.TiVo files instead of the standard <b>tivodecode</b> program. This is<br>\
useful for cases when the .TiVo files are in a format that tivodecode cannot decrypt<br>\
such as for Transport Stream (TS) format .TiVo files.<br>\
NOTE: You must have TiVo Desktop (or at least TiVoDirectShowFilter.dll) installed for this to work.<br>\
NOTE: DirectShow Dump cannot be combined with download task, so you should disable kmttg<br>\
config option <b>Combine downlad and tivodecode decrypt</b> if enabled in order to use this option.
tooltip_tivolibreDecrypt=<b>Decrypt using tivolibre instead of tivodecode</b><br>\
Enable this option to decrypt .TiVo files using Java tivolibre instead of the standard<br>\
<b>tivodecode</b> program. This is useful for cases when the .TiVo files are in a format that<br>\
tivodecode cannot decrypt such as for Transport Stream (TS) format .TiVo files.
tooltip_tivolibreCompat=<b>tivolibre DirectShow compatibility mode</b><br>\
If enabled then tivolibre DirectShow compatiblity will be used which tries to keep the<br>\
resulting decrypted file binary compatible with a DirectShow decryption, complete with<br>\
null and unencrypted packets.<br>\
This is especially useful for debugging tivolibre issues and comparing vs DirectShowDump.
tooltip_httpserver_enable=<b>Enable web server</b><br>\
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b><br>\
Enabling web browser allows you to interact with kmttg via any web browser with<br>\
a subset of kmttg capabilities and capability to stream videos from computer<br>\
running kmttg to any browser. This is experimental because some functions are<br>\
still a work in progress and not robust, especially video streaming.<br>\
NOTE: TiVos listed in web browser are intentionally restricted to series 4 or later only.
tooltip_httpserver_port=<b>web server port</b><br>\
Port to use for web server. See web server setting and associated tooltip above.<br>\
NOTE: In your router configuration you can setup WAN port forwarding such as to enable<br>\
access to web server from outside your home, so if you leave kmttg running then<br>\
you can access the web server capabilities from anywhere.
tooltip_httpserver_cache=<b>web server cache dir</b><br>\
Directory to use for web server cache files. These files are created when using<br>\
web server <b>Video Streaming</b> page to transcode files to HLS. Note that since these<br>\
are video files it's possible a lot of space may be needed, so make sure there is plenty<br>\
of space where you define this directory.
tooltip_httpserver_share_filter=<b>Share browser show video files only</b><br>\
For <b>Share Browser</b> page only show video files if this option is enabled.
tooltip_VrdEncode=<b>Show VideoRedo encoding profiles</b><br>\
If you have VideoRedo and have configured kmttg with the installation path<br>\
to VideoRedo, when this option is enabled kmttg will add VideoRedo encoding<br>\
profiles to list of available encoding profiles to use for <b>encode</b> task.<br>\
NOTE: You must have VideoRedo with H.264 support (TVSuite4 or later) in order<br>\
to use this option. kmttg will scan all your VideoRedo TVS4 output profiles<br>\
to display as encoding and/or remuxing choices.
tooltip_VrdAllowMultiple=<b>Run all VideoRedo jobs in GUI mode</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will launch all VideoRedo tasks in GUI mode<br>\
instead of silent/background mode. Depending on your flow this may be necessary<br>\
because silent mode runs interfere with any GUI versions of VideoRedo you may be<br>\
running. If you're going to be actively using VideoRedo GUI while kmttg is running<br>\
then you will need to turn this option on.
tooltip_VrdCombineCutEncode=<b>Combine Ad Cut & Encode</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then for the <b>Ad Cut</b> task, kmttg will use VideoRedo<br>\
to cut commercials and encode to selected VideoRedo encoding profile in a single step<br>\
instead of cutting commercials and outputting mpeg2 _cut.mpg file as is the normal flow.<br>\
NOTE: You must set <b>Encoding Profile</b> in GUI to a VideoRedo encoding profile or<br>\
else kmttg will generate an error message and the Ad Cut task won't be scheduled.<br>\
NOTE: You should also enable <b>Show VideoRedo encoding profles</b> option if you<br>\
enable this option.
tooltip_VrdQsfixMpeg2ps=<b>Force QS Fix output to always be mpeg2 Program Stream</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then for the <b>QS Fix</b> task, kmttg will force VideoRedo<br>\
to output mpeg2 program stream format regardless of the input video format.<br>\
Thus for example if the input file is Mpeg2 Transport Stream format then the output<br>\
will be Mpeg2 Program Stream.
tooltip_VrdOneAtATime=<b>Only allow 1 VRD job at a time</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then only 1 VideoRedo job will be allowed to run at a time.
tooltip_TSDownload=<b>Download TiVo files in Transport Stream format</b><br>\
For TiVo software that properly supports it, this forces TiVo file downloads to use<br>\
the faster Transport Stream format instead of the default Program Stream format.<br>\
NOTE: Only Series 4 or later TiVos support this format and this will have no effect on other TiVos.<br>\
<b>NOTE: 'tivodecode' cannot properly decrypt TS TiVo files, so if you enable this option</b><br>\
<b>you should also turn on option to use 'tivolibre' or 'DirectShowDump' or 'VideoRedo' for the</b><br>\
<b>'decrypt' task</b>.<br>\
<b>NOTE: Enabling this option is required for H.264 downloads to work properly</b>.
tooltip_TivoWebPlusDelete=<b>Enable TivoWebPlus Delete task</b><br>\
If you have TivoWebPlus configured on your TiVo(s) then if you enable this option<br>\
an optional <b>TWP Delete</b> task is made available in the kmttg GUI or auto transfers<br>\
task set. When task is enabled, a TivoWebPlus http call to delete show on TiVo will be<br>\
issued following successful decrypt of a downloaded .TiVo file.<br>\
NOTE: Once you set and save this option you must restart kmttg to see the change.
tooltip_rpcDelete=<b>Enable rpc style delete task</b><br>\
For Series 4 TiVos if you have <b>Network Remote</b> option enabled and this option<br>\
enabled an optional <b>rpc Delete</b> task is made available in the kmttg GUI or auto transfers<br>\
task set. When task is enabled, rpc communications protocol is used to delete show on TiVo<br>\
following a successful decrypt of a downloaded .TiVo file.<br>\
<b>NOTE: Once you set and save this option you must restart kmttg to see the change.</b>
tooltip_HideProtectedFiles=<b>Do not show copy protected files in table</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then copy protected TiVo shows are not displayed in the<br>\
TiVo Now Playing lists.
tooltip_OverwriteFiles=<b>Overwrite existing files</b><br>\
With this option disabled kmttg will skip tasks for which output files already exist<br>\
so as not to overwrite any existing files of same name on your computer.<br>\
With this option enabled kmttg will run tasks regardless of whether their output files<br>\
exist or not, overwriting existing files as needed.
tooltip_DeleteFailedDownloads=<b>Delete failed downloads</b><br>\
With this option disabled kmttg will not delete a failed file download attempt.<br>\
This only useful disabled if you want to keep a partial download and you also have<br>\
<b>Overwrite existing files</b> option disabled or <b># download attempts</b> option<br>\
set to 0 or 1. By disabling this option note that you can end up with partial downloads<br>\
so most users will probably want to keep this option enabled.
tooltip_combine_download_decrypt=<b>Combine download and decrypt</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will try to combine the download and decrypt tasks into<br>\
a single step instead of the default 2 step process (skipping intermediate TiVo file generation).<br>\
NOTE: You still need to enable both <b>download</b> and <b>decrypt</b> tasks for a show for this<br>\
to apply - if you do not enable <b>decrypt</b> task then still only download to TiVo file is performed.<br>\
NOTE: This option is not relevant if using VideoRedo qsfix or DirectShow dump decrypt which must<br>\
be performed separately from downloads.
tooltip_single_download=<b>Allow only 1 download at a time</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will only download 1 program at a time no matter how many<br>\
TiVos you have and how many download tasks are queued up. The usual restriction is only 1 download<br>\
at a time per TiVo, which means you can still have simultaneous downloads for different TiVos. This<br>\
option restricts that further to only 1 at a time for all TiVos.
tooltip_rpcnpl=<b>Use RPC to get NPL when possible</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will use RPC for obtaining NPL listings whenever possible<br>\
for series 4 or later TiVos only. This avoids the traditional 2 step process of obtaining XML<br>\
listings followed by <b>remote</b> call when refreshing NPL tables.
tooltip_enableRpc=<b>Enable rpc style communications with this TiVo</b><br>\
If this option is enabled then kmttg will use rpc style communications with the TiVo to enable<br>\
extra functionality such as capability to play & delete shows from Now Playing list and also to<br>\
allow viewing of To Do list, Season Pass list and direct remote control capabilities.<br>\
If enabled then you can play/delete shows from Now Playing List table as follows:<br>\
<b>PLAY:</b> Select a show in Now Playing List and press <b>space bar</b> key.<br>\
<b>DELETE:</b> Select a show in Now Playing List and press <b>delete</b> key.<br>\
<b>If enabled, you will see an additional 'Remote' tab</b>.<br>\
<b>NOTE: This only works with Series 4 (Premiere) TiVos or later.</b>
tooltip_files_path=<b>FILES Default Path</b><br>\
Defines where you would like the file browser to start from in <b>FILES</b> mode.<br>\
<b>NOTE: Double-click mouse in this field to bring up File Browser</b>.
tooltip_MAK=<b>MAK</b><br>\
<b>REQUIRED</b> setting if you plan to download and/or decrypt files from your TiVos.<br>\
This is your TiVo <b>Media Access Key</b> 10 digit number.<br>\
You can find the number on any of your networked Tivos as follows:<br>\
<b>Tivo Central-Messages&Settings-Account&System Information-Media Access Key</b>
tooltip_FontSize=<b>GUI Font Size</b><br>\
Sets the text font size to use for all text GUI components.
tooltip_file_naming=<b>File Naming</b><br>\
This defines the file naming template for kmttg to use when downloading files<br>\
from your TiVos. The <b>Available Keywords</b> entries to the right contain<br>\
all the valid recognized keywords. Consult the kmttg documentation for all the<br>\
details on the meaning of each keyword and for advanced file naming setup.<br>\
<b>NOTE: Several special characters are stripped or mapped from file names to avoid</b><br>\
<b>potential problems with the various helper tools being used.</b><br>\
<b>Consult the kmttg documentation on this option for details on that</b>
tooltip_tivo_output_dir=<b>.TiVo Output Dir</b><br>\
<b>REQUIRED</b> if you plan to download files from your TiVos.<br>\
This defines location where TiVo files are download to.<br>\
NOTE: Make sure to have plenty of disk space available at this location.<br>\
