=KMTTG MAC OSX INSTALLATION=

==1. INSTALL JAVA IF NEEDED==

Kmttg is now written in Java (originally used Perl) and supports Java 1.5 or later. You can download Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from here:

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

==2. DOWNLOAD KMTTG INSTALLATION ZIP FILE==

Download kmttg installation zip file from:

http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/downloads/list

    * *kmttg_vxxx.zip* file â€“ This contains the platform independent kmttg installation files
    * v0p6a or later are Java versions. Versions prior to that were Perl based and should no longer be used.

==3. UNPACK ZIP FILE==

  * Unpack *kmttg_vxxx.zip* file to your desired location. In this example: /home/moyekj (this creates /home/moyekj/kmttg_vxxx folder)

==STARTING KMTTG==
  * Run the *kmttg* script in the installation folder to start kmttg.
  * The first time launch you will be prompted for your 10 digit Media Access Key (MAK) which is needed to download & decrypt programs from your Tivos. If you already have a ~/.tivodecode_mak file containing the MAK number then kmttg will automatically read it from there.
  * kmttg uses "which" to try and determine the location of the various 3rd party tools. If you don't have them in your PATH then you will need to manually specify the locations of the tools if you have them.
  * You will probably need to further configure kmttg after installation. Consult the [http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/wiki/configuring_kmttg configuring_kmttg] wiki page for details.
