==VIDEOREDO SPECIAL CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS==

===COMSKIP SETUP===
By default comskip.ini is not setup to create a .VPrj file that can be used by {{{VideoRedo}}} for detected commercial segment cutting. You should edit the comskip\comskip.ini file and find the *output_videoredo=0* setting and change it to *output_videoredo=1*.

===WINDOWS SERVICE===
When running in service mode with the default kmttg Windows Service configuration {{{VideoRedo}}} will fail to run with an error such as {{{"WScript.CreateObject: Could not create object named VideoReDo.VideoReDoSilent"}}}

The fix to this problem is to configure the kmttg service to run using a Local Account. You can do that as follows:

  * *Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Services*
  * Scroll down and find *kmttg* entry
  * Right click on *kmttg* and stop service if it is running
  * Right click on kmttg and select *Properties*
  * Choose *Log On* tab
  * Click on *This account* and type in a valid user account for this computer along with the password to go along with it.
  * OK the form
