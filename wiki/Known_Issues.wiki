==Encoding profile naming must be lowercase==
If you make your own encoding profiles (name.enc files under encode folder) be sure to use all lowercase file names otherwise they won't work when used in auto transfers mode.

==VideoRedo==
  * VideoRedo won't run properly using the default kmttg service setup.
  * VideoRedo QuickStream Fix won't run from kmttg in either service mode or from GUI.
  * For both above issues consult the [http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/wiki/VideoRedo_configuration VideoRedo_configuration] wiki page for details on how to fix that.

==comcut creates audio/video sync issues==
If you have comcut step enabled using mencoder to make the cuts very often this results in audio/video sync issues. If you have VideoRedo enabled in kmttg it will be used instead to make the cuts and works much better.

==encoding creates audio/video sync issues===
Recordings originating from Tivos very often have timestamp defects that lead to problems if not corrected before encoding to other video formats. VideoRedo Quick Stream Fix is the only (non-free) tool out there that can reliably correct these defects such that when you encode the faulty recording to other formats it will be perfectly in sync.
