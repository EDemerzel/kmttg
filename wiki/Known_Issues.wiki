==Encoding profile naming must be lowercase==
If you make your own encoding profiles (name.enc files under encode folder) be sure to use all lowercase file names otherwise they won't work when used in auto transfers mode.

==*`VideoRedo`* in windows service mode==
`VideoRedo` won't run properly using the default kmttg service setup. Consult the [http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/wiki/VideoRedo_configuration VideoRedo_configuration] wiki page for details on how to fix that.

==comcut creates audio/video sync issues==
If you have comcut step enabled using mencoder to make the cuts very often this results in audio/video sync issues. If you have `VideoRedo` enabled in kmttg it will be used instead to make the cuts and works much better.
