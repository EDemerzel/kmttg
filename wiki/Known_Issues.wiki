==Encoding profile naming must be lowercase==
If you make your own encoding profiles (name.enc files under encode folder) be sure to use all lowercase file names otherwise they won't work when used in auto transfers mode.

==VRD QS fix in windows service mode==
Currently VideoRedo Quickstream Fix doesn't work when run as a windows service, so if using kmttg in windows service mode you need to avoid enabling VRD QS fix step.

==comcut creates audio/video sync issues==
If you have comcut step enabled using mencoder to make the cuts very often this results in audio/video sync issues. If you have VideoRedo enabled in kmttg it will be used instead to make the cuts and works much better.
