==KMTTG ADVANTAGES==

===Viewing TiVo Listings===
  * Uses tabs to easily switch between viewing of listings for all your networked TiVos.
  * Does not require re-download of listings when switching views.
  * Can decide when to refresh listings for each TiVo.
  * Listings contain information about bit rate for each show.
  * Ability to view detailed Disk Usage information as a pie chart along with a summary of bit rate information per channel.

===Auto Transfers===
  * Can automatically pull files from all networked TiVos as background service using flexible title and/or keyword based matching.
  * Ability to use regex expressions in setting up title matching such that for example you can pull all recordings from your TiVos and define various exclusion or inclusion filters.

===Encoding to different formats===
  * Along with several built in encoding profiles allows user to define own custom encoding profiles or modify existing ones.

===Extra capabilities===
  * Integration with commercial detection and cutting tools.
  * Can generate closed captions (.srt) files.
  * Close integration with *pyTivo* - can generate metadata files and push files automatically back to TiVos.

===VideoRedo Integration===
