(Make note of Java installation directory)

Once installed start a cmd window

mkdir c:\kmttg
cd c:\kmttg
svn checkout http://kmttg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ .
set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.5.0_16" [change this to match what you noted was the installation directory for the JDK].
ant

release\kmttg.jar contains the compiled code.
