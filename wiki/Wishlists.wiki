Wishlists and kmttg

==WISHLIST RESTRICTIONS==
  * RPC protocol limitations impose certain restrictions on what can be done with wishlists via kmttg. Specifically:
    * Only autorecord wishlists are visible and editable, so if you want to edit or remove non-autorecord wishlists you will need to do it on TiVo itself.
    * Even though wishlist titles are mandatory when creating wishlists they will take on a name of their own and you will have to use the TiVo itself to change the name.
    * It's not possible to obtain list of category IDs, so adding categories to wishlists is not available.

==WISHLIST SYNTAX==
  * You can specify multiple sets of keywords separated by a , (comma).
  * If keywords start with a - (minus) then that signifies NOT operation.
  * If keywords are enclosed in parentheses (keywords) that signifies OPTIONAL.
  * Keywords without a - or enclosed in parentheses are taken as REQUIRED.
