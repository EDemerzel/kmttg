=KMTTG WINDOWS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS=

==1. INSTALL JAVA IF NEEDED==

Kmttg is now written in Java (originally used Perl) and supports Java 1.5 or later. You can download Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from here:

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

==2. DOWNLOAD KMTTG INSTALLATION ZIP FILE==

Download kmttg installation zip file from:

http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/downloads/list

    * *kmttg_vxxx.zip* file â€“ This contains the platform independent kmttg installation files
    * v0p6a or later are Java versions. Versions prior to that were Perl based and should no longer be used.

==3. UNPACK ZIP FILE==

  * Unpack *kmttg_vxxx.zip* file to your desired location. In this example: c:\home (this creates c:\home\kmttg_vxxx folder)

===TIP===
If upgrading from a previous Java kmttg installation you can normally unzip over the previous installation or just replace the *kmttg.jar* file of the old installation with the one from the new installation. That way you can preserve the kmttg configuration and avoid having to re-configure. NOTE: In some cases there are other files such as encoding profiles updated as part of a release, so you can also just unzip the file over the top of your previous installation to make sure you overwrite all files that make up an installation.

==4. STARTING KMTTG==
Simply double click on *kmttg.jar* file (c:\home\kmttg_vxxx\kmttg.jar in this example) of the installation to start the program. (You can also create a shortcut to that file if you wish to make it easier).
  * The first time launch you will be prompted to allow kmttg to download and install required tools. Choose Yes and wait for the download and installation to complete.
  * Also the first time you launch kmttg you will be prompted for your 10 digit Media Access Key (MAK) which is needed to download & decrypt programs from your Tivos.
  NOTE: kmttg may detect Tivos on your network before you have a chance to enter the 10 digit MAK, and will not be able to get listings for detected Tivos without MAK, so after entering MAK you will need to click on *Refresh List* button for each Tivo to get listings.
  * You will probably want to further configure kmttg after installation. Consult the [http://code.google.com/p/kmttg/wiki/configuring_kmttg configuring_kmttg] wiki page for details.
