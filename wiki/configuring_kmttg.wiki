=CONFIGURING KMTTG=
*This step is very important and must be run at least the first time you start kmttg.*

  * Start kmttg if you have not done so already.
  * From *File* pulldown menu select *Configure…*
  * Adjust settings according to your environment
  * At bare minimum you should enter proper *MAK* value and define *`.TiVo`* dir (where to save download `.TiVo` files).
  NOTE: As of version 0.5l kmttg will automatically detect any Tivos on your network and add them to Tivos list, but you can optionally add tivos yourself if you wish.

  NOTE: You can specify different output directories for `.TiVo` files, `.mpg` files and encoded files if you wish or you can set them all the same.
  * OK the form when you have completed your configuration. This will save your settings to config.ini file so they will be remembered next time you run kmttg.

==MANUALLY ENTERING TIVO NAMES AND IP NUMBERS==
  * Starting with version 0.5l kmttg will automatically detect and add Tivos on your network, so you can choose to skip steps below that detail how to manually add tivos to kmttg.
  * Supply a Tivo name in the *Tivo Name* field and the associated Tivo IP number in the *Tivo IP#* field.
  EXAMPLE: *Tivo Name = Bedroom   Tivo IP# = 192.168.1.101*
  * You can find Tivo IP numbers for each of your Tivos as follows:
  Tivo Central—Messages&Settings—Settings—Phone&Network: IP addr
  * Click on *ADD* button to add the entry to the Tivos list
  * If you want to remove entries, then select them in the Tivos list and click on DEL button.

==FILES Default Path==
  * Defines where you would like the file browser to start from in FILES mode.
  * NOTE: You can use this option without having any Tivos defined if you wish.

 
==Remove `.TiVo` file after decrypt==
  * Enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove `.TiVo` files automatically once they have been successfully decrypted to .mpg format.

==Remove .edl & .mpg files after comcut==
  * If you use comcut you can enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove .edl & .mpg files automatically once comcut completes succesfully.

==Remove .mpg file after encode==
  * If you use encode you can enable this option if you would like kmttg to remove .mpg files automatically once they have been successfully re-encoded.


==MAK==
  * REQUIRED if you plan to download files from Tivo Now Playing lists.
  * Your Tivo Media Access Key. You can find the number on any of your Tivos:
  Tivo Central—Messages&Settings—Account&System Information—Media Access Key

==File Naming==
  * This defines how file names will look for downloaded shows. Certain keywords are provided which you specify within square brackets that will be substituted accordingly. You can use almost any other characters you want (*avoid quotes!*) and arrange the keywords in any order you like.
  * EXAMPLE:  Let’s say you have a recorded show as follows:
*Mon 3/24/2008 at 8:00pm called “The Big Bang Theory – The Loobenfeld Decay” from channel 702=KCBSDT*<br>
`Keywords in this example are:`<br>
`[title] = The Big Bang Theory – The Loobenfeld Decay`<br>
`[mainTitle] = The Big Bang Theory`<br>
`[episodeTitle] = The Loobenfeld Decay`<br>
`[channelNum] = 702`<br>
`[channel] = KCBSDT`<br>
`[min] = 00`<br>
`[hour] = 20`<br>
`[wday] = Mon`<br>
`[mday] = 24`<br>
`[month] = Mar`<br>
`[monthNum] = 03`<br>
`[year] = 2008`<br>

So continuing with above example, if I set:<br>
*`File Naming = [title] (Recorded [month] [mday],[year],[channel])`*<br>
The `.TiVo` file name would become:<br>
*`The Big Bang Theory – The Loobenfeld Decay (Recorded Mar 17,2008,KABCDT).TiVo`*<br>

The `[/]` keyword is a folder separator which allows you to create custom sub-folder names as part of the output file definition. Continuing above example:<br>
*`File Naming = [mainTitle][/][year]_[monthNum]_[mday] [episodeTitle]`*<br>
The `.TiVo` file name would become (using Windows folder structure note the resulting sub-folder structure):<br>
*`The Big Bang Theory\2008_03_24 The Loobenfeld Decay.TiVo`*

==Advanced File Naming==

By request some more advanced keyword processing was introduced to allow for conditional text.
  * You can define multiple space separated fields within square brackets.
  * Fields surrounded by quotes are treated as literal text.
  * A single field with no quotes should be supplied which represents a conditional keyword
  * If that keyword is available for the show in question then the keyword value along with any literal text surrounding it will be included in file name.
  * If the keyword evaluates to null then the entire advanced keyword becomes null. 
  * For example:<br>
`[mainTitle]`*`["_Ep#" EpisodeNumber]`*`_[wday]_[month]_[mday]`<br>

The advanced keyword is highlighted in bold and signifies only include `“_Ep#xxx”` if `EpisodeNumber` exists for the show in question. `“_Ep#”` is literal string to which the evaluated contents of `EpisodeNumber` keyword are appended. If `EpisodeNumber` does not exist then the whole advanced keyword evaluates to empty string.
