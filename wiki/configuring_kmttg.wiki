=CONFIGURING KMTTG=
*This step is very important and must be run at least the first time you start kmttg.*

  * Start kmttg if you have not done so already.
  * From *File* pulldown menu select *Configureâ€¦*
  * Adjust settings according to your environment
  * At bare minimum you should enter proper *MAK* value and define *.TiVo* dir (where to save download .TiVo files).
  NOTE: As of version 0.5l kmttg will automatically detect any Tivos on your network and add them to Tivos list, but you can optionally add tivos yourself if you wish.
  NOTE: You can specify different output directories for .TiVo files, .mpg files and encoded files if you wish or you can set them all the same.
  * OK the form when you have completed your configuration. This will save your settings to config.ini file so they will be remembered next time you run kmttg.
