=DEBUGGING PROBLEMS=
If you are having problems getting the program to start or run properly here are some things to try:

1. In GUI mode check the kmttg text area for errors (red text) for clues about what the problem could be. For non-graphical/service mode all error messages go to auto.log file. Any Java stack trace messages will go to the message window in GUI mode or to auto.log file in non-graphical mode.

2. Triple check your configuration setup (*File->Configure…*) for any syntax errors in IP #s, MAK, paths, etc.

3. If in windows when you double-click on kmttg.jar it doesn't run  then open a cmd window and run program from command line to be able to see any error messages:<br>
*java -jar kmttg.jar*

4. Start kmttg from command line with -d argument to generate a lot of debug information that is saved to debug.log file:
<br>
*java -jar kmttg.jar -d*

5. If you still can’t figure out what’s wrong ask for help at [http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?t=387725 Tivo Community Forums kmttg thread]
