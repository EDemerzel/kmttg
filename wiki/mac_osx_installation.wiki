=KMTTG MAC OSX INSTALLATION=

(special thanks to AudioNutz in Tivo Community forums for putting this together)

==1. INSTALL XCODE TOOLS==
The Tk module for the Perl GUI will need the X11 environment to be compiled, installed, and executed. Locate your Mac OS X installation DVD, and install the XCode Tools.

==2. INSTALL PERL (ONLY IF NEEDED)==
Most Macs with “Tiger” (Mac OS X 10.4.x) or “Leopard” (Mac OS X 10.5.x) already have Perl 5.8.x installed, so you can skip to the part below where you install the Tk module.

Kmttg is written in Perl and uses the Tk module for GUI. Perl versions 5.8.x is confirmed to work as long as you have the proper Tk module.

Note that Macintosh ActivePerl version does not include Tk module by default and therefore requires more work to install – see details below.

If by some miracle your Macintosh does not have Perl installed:

  * http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/
  * Click on Get ActivePerl
  * Click on Download by free download version
  * Click on Continue
  * For 5.8.x version (on right side) scroll down and find the relevant installation file for your system
  * Download and install on your system. NOTE: This step can vary depending on your system so is not documented here.
