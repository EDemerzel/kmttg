=KMTTG MAC OSX INSTALLATION=

(special thanks to AudioNutz in Tivo Community forums for putting this together)

==1. INSTALL XCODE TOOLS==
The Tk module for the Perl GUI will need the X11 environment to be compiled, installed, and executed. Locate your Mac OS X installation DVD, and install the XCode Tools.

==2. INSTALL PERL (ONLY IF NEEDED)==
Most Macs with “Tiger” (Mac OS X 10.4.x) or “Leopard” (Mac OS X 10.5.x) already have Perl 5.8.x installed, so you can skip to the part below where you install the Tk module.

Kmttg is written in Perl and uses the Tk module for GUI. Perl versions 5.8.x is confirmed to work as long as you have the proper Tk module.

Note that Macintosh ActivePerl version does not include Tk module by default and therefore requires more work to install – see details below.

If by some miracle your Macintosh does not have Perl installed:

  * http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/
  * Click on Get ActivePerl
  * Click on Download by free download version
  * Click on Continue
  * For 5.8.x version (on right side) scroll down and find the relevant installation file for your system
  * Download and install on your system. NOTE: This step can vary depending on your system so is not documented here.

==3. INSTALLING PERL Tk MODULE USING Terminal and X11==
  * http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/Tk-804.027/
  * If you are using Safari, make sure that your browser is not set to “Open safe files after downloading”.
  * Download the latest release.
  * Move the Tk-804.028.tar.gz to your /System/Library/Perl/lib folder I suppose you can put it anywhere you like. I just put it here to keep things tidy.
  * Change permissions of this folder, so that you have rights to install software here. (Make a note as to what the permissions were, as you will want to change them back later)
  * Open a Terminal window, and execute the following commands: (May differ if you’ve changed the install location)

BUILD EXAMPLE

cd /System/Library/Perl/lib
<br>
tar -zxvpf Tk-804.028.tar.gz
<br>
cd Tk-804.028
<br>
perl Makefile.PL
<br>
make
<br>
Now go to your “Utilities” folder on your Hard Drive, and open an X11 window.
<br>
In the X11 window, type the following commands :
<br>
cd /System/Library/Perl/lib/Tk-804.028
<br>
make test
<br>
(Stand back and watch this happen)
<br>
sudo make install

  * Perl and Tk are now ready. Change the permissions for “/System/Library/Perl/lib” back to what they were when you began. (This step may not be necessary, but I like to keep my Mac tidy)

==INSTALL THE HELPER TOOLS==
AudioNutz was kind enough to package up a zip file with the tools needed:

==STARTING KMTTG==
Simplest way to run kmttg:
